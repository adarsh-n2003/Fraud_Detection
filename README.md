### **Credit Card Fraud Detection**

**Description:**
This repository contains code for a credit card fraud detection project. The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately detect fraudulent transactions in credit card data.

**Dataset:**
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). It consists of credit card transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013, containing a total of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, with only 492 (0.172%) of them being fraudulent. Each transaction contains 30 features, which are numerical anonymized features obtained through PCA transformation due to privacy concerns. Additionally, there is a 'Class' column indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent (1) or not (0).

**Contents:**

- **`credit_card_fraud_detection.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and evaluation.
- **`credit_card_dataset.csv`**: CSV file containing the credit card transaction data.
- **`README.md`**: Readme file providing an overview of the project, dataset information, and instructions for usage.

**Instructions:**

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Download the **`credit_card_dataset.csv`** file from the Kaggle dataset link provided above and place it in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook.
3. Open and run the **`credit_card_fraud_detection.ipynb`** notebook in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
4. Follow along with the notebook to understand the data preprocessing steps, exploratory data analysis, model building using Random Forest Classifier, and evaluation of the model's performance.
5. Optionally, modify the code or experiment with different algorithms to further improve the fraud detection model.

**Dependencies:**

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

**Note:**

- Ensure that the dataset file (**`credit_card_dataset.csv`**) is correctly placed in the same directory as the notebook for the code to execute without errors.
- This project serves as a demonstration of credit card fraud detection using machine learning techniques and can be further extended or customized as per specific requirements.
